### 3.1.1 Diagram explaination

- **User Interface**: The entry point for users interacting with the application, including navigating through different pages and triggering actions.
- **Pages**: Defined using Next.js, each page component corresponds to a route in the application.
- **Routing (Next.js)**: Handles the application's routing, dynamically loading the appropriate page components based on the URL.
- **Layouts**: Reusable layout components that define the common structure of pages (e.g., header, footer).
- **Components**: Reusable UI components used within pages and layouts, such as buttons, input fields, and cards.
- **Contexts/Hooks**: Utilized for managing application state and logic, sharing data across components.
- **Services**: Functions or classes that handle external API calls, interacting with databases or other services.
- **Supabase Database**: The backend database where application data is stored and retrieved.
- **Styled Components**: Enables CSS-in-JS styling, allowing each component to have its encapsulated style.

### 3.2 Architecture

- **assets**: Static files like images, fonts, and other media.
- **components**: Reusable UI components.
- **contexts**: React context providers for state management.
- **hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared logic.
- **layouts**: Components that define different page layouts.
- **pages**: Components representing individual pages, likely routed in Next.js.
- **screens**: Larger components or containers that may compose multiple components.
- **services**: Functions or classes for interacting with external services or APIs.
- **styles**: Global stylesheets or theme-related styling.
- **themes**: Theming configurations or definitions.
